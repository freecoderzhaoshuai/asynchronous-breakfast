### Task
Threads are costly <br>
Task avoids the overhead of creating too many threads <br>
Task are executed by the TaskScheduler which runs on the threadpool <br>
For long running operations, the threadpool can fill up and it is better to spin up a new thread <br>

### Async/ Await
Async and Await is syntactic sugar that makes calling async code more readable <br>
